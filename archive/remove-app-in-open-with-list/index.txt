<h1>How to remove app in open with list</h1>
<p>We all know that there are many different file types in the computer, and each file has its own program to open it.</p>
<p>In Windows OS, programs that can open files of this type will be placed in <strong>Open with</strong> in the right-click menu.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two deleted program in my right-click menu open with list.</p>

<p>Google Chrome and WPS PDF.</p>
<p>These software have been removed from this computer by me,
but their installation information remains in the registry.</p>
<p>Let me show you how to delete them.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm assuming you have a general understanding of computers and know what a registry is.</p>
<h2>WPS PDF</h2>
<p>To find out where the Key is in the registry, I do follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open regedit</li>
<li>Make a global search &quot;WPS PDF&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I found the following locations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-reg">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\wpspdf.exe
</code></pre>
<p>And I don't found a key that may be related to it elsewhere.
So I guess, this key is the information left in the registry.</p>
<p>After deleting this key, &quot;WSP PDF&quot; removed from open with list.</p>
<p>(You should make a <strong>backup</strong> of the registry in advance)</p>
<h2>Google Chrome in .html</h2>
<p>To find out where the Key is in the registry, I do follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open regedit</li>
<li>Make a global search &quot;Google Chrome&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike last time, this time I found a lot of similar keys.</p>
<p><img src="/archive/remove-app-in-open-with-list/clip_20220622_023233.png" alt="found &quot;Google Chrome&quot;" /></p>
<p>So I switched my thinking and started with the file extension.</p>
<p>Because the extension of this file is <code>.html</code>, so I goto this location:</p>
<pre><code class="language-reg">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.html\OpenWithProgids
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/archive/remove-app-in-open-with-list/clip_20220622_013000.png" alt=".html OpenWithProgids" /></p>
<p>Here I found a suspicious key <code>ChromeHTML</code>, so I deleted it.</p>
<p>Later, &quot;Google Chrome&quot; was also removed from the open with list.</p>
<h2>Google Chrome in other extensions file</h2>
<p>After that I look globally for the word ChromeHTML in the registry.
I found that in addition to <code>.html</code>, <code>.htm</code> <code>.shtml</code> <code>.svg</code> <code>.xht</code> <code>.xhtml</code> also have <code>ChromeHTML</code> in <code>OpenWithProgids</code> key.</p>
<p>I tried creating several files with these extensions and sure enough &quot;Google Chrome&quot; was in their open with list.</p>
<p>So I delete <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ChromeHTML</code> and then &quot;Google Chrome&quot; was also removed from their open with list.</p>
<h2>KuGou8</h2>
<p>In the process of searching, I found that there is a <code>kugou8</code> key in my registry.</p>
<p>I created an mp3 file, and in the open with list, there is indeed a kugou program.</p>
<p><img src="/archive/remove-app-in-open-with-list/clip_20220622_033135.png" alt="Open with kugou" /></p>
<p>From experience, I suspect it is and . mp3 this suffix is bound.
So I goto:</p>
<pre><code class="language-reg">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>And found a key <code>kugou8.mp3</code></p>
<p><img src="/archive/remove-app-in-open-with-list/clip_20220622_032016.png" alt="mp3 key" /></p>
<p>After I remove it, &quot;Kugou&quot; is remove from my open with list.</p>
<p>However, there are still many other files that are bundled with kugou. Like <code>.wav</code> <code>.flac</code> <code>.wma</code></p>
<p>I'm a little tired, so I looked for kugou8 globally in the registry and deleted them all.</p>
